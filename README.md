# pycalc
CLI calculator written in python

Currently supports:
- `^*x/+-` as infix operators
- `!` as postfix operators
- `sin`,`cos`,`tan`,`asin`,`arcsin`,`acos`,`arccos`,`atan`,`arctan`, as prefix operators
- `([{}])`
- `e`, `tau`

other infix operators, prefix operators, postfix operators, and constants can be added easily.

The inferior circle constant, pi, will not be added.
