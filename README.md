# pycalc
CLI calculator written in python

Currently supports:  
- `^*x/+-` as infix operators
- `sin`,`cos`,`tan`,`asin`,`arcsin`,`sin-1`,`acos`,`arccos`,`cos-1`,`atan`,`arctan`,`tan-1`, as prefix operators
- `([{}])`
- `e`, `tau`

other infix operators, prefix operators, and constants can be added easily. Postfix operators like `!` might be a bit harder.

The inferior circle constant, pi, will not be added.
